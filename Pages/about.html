      <h3>What is Valorant?</h3>

    </div>

      <h3>Unrated</h3>
      <p>In the standard non-ranked mode, the match is played as best of 25 - the first team to win 13 rounds wins the match.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Spike Rush</h3>
      <p>In the Spike Rush mode, the match is played as best of 7 rounds - the first team to win 4 rounds wins the match. Players begin the round with all abilities fully charged except their ultimate, which charges twice as fast as in standard games. All players on the attacking team carry a spike, but only one spike may be activated per round. Guns are randomized in every round and every player begins with the same gun. Ultimate point orbs in the standard game are present, as well as multiple different power-up orbs.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Swiftplay</h3>
      <p>Swiftplay matches are simply a shortened version of the Unrated game mode. 10 players are split into 2 teams, attackers and defenders. Attackers must plant the spike while the Defenders must stop them. What differs Swiftplay to Unrated is that it is best to 9 rounds - the first team to win 5 rounds wins the match. On round 4, the team's players switch, as they would do in round 7 in the Unrated game mode. The game's currency system has no changes from Unrated. Swiftplay is meant as a quick game mode, averaging around 15 minutes per game, as opposed to around 40 minutes for Unrated.</p>

      <h3>Competitive</h3>
      <p>Competitive matches are the same as unranked matches with the addition of a win-based ranking system that assigns a rank to each player after 5 games are played. Players are required to reach level 20 before playing this mode.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Premier</h3>
      <p>Premier is a 5v5 gamemode that allows players a path-to-pro competitive game mode that is aimed towards players that wish to be a professional player.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Deathmatch</h3>
      <p>14 players enter a 9-minute free-for-all match and the first person to reach 40 kills or the player who has the most kills when time is up wins the match. The players will spawn with a random agent, equipped with a max shield and an infinite supply of credits to buy any weapons from the buy menu. All abilities are disabled during the match.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Team Deathmatch</h3>
      <p>This gamemode combines and borrows elements from the standard unrated mode as well as the regular deathmatch mode. It is a free-for-all gamemode where players are split into two teams with five players each. Each match lasts for 9 minutes and 30 seconds, and the first team that reaches 100 kills win. If neither team has reached 100 kills at the end of the 9.5 minutes, then the team with the most kills wins.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Escalation</h3>
      <p>the "gungame" concept found in Counter-Strike and Call of Duty: Black Ops, though it is team-based rather than free-for-all with 5 players on each team. The game will pick a random selection of 12 weapons to move through. As with other gungame versions, a team needs to get a certain number of kills to advance to the next weapon and the weapons get progressively worse as the team moves through them.</p>
